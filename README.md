### Hi there 👋

I'm Andrea De Angelis, currently an Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) in Computational Social and Political Sciences at the University of Milan. I am also an SNF Ambizione Researcher in the Department of Political Science at the University of Zurich. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** The project “Political Misinformation in the Digital Age,” funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. My research focuses on political misinformation, computational social scienes, and public opinion in Western democracies.
  
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** How to use LLMs for my teaching and research (ideas are welcome!). 

- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Projects at the intersection of political science, computational methods, and digital media. I am especially interested in collaborations that explore the dynamics of political misinformation and media effects on electoral decisions.
